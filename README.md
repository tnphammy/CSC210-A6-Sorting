## Assignment Reflection

What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?
- My original betting places (slowest to fastest): SelectionSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, Quicksort. I was wrong about Quicksort! It was not that quick compared to MergeSort. It was much closer to InsertionSort in runtime. I also did not realize InsertionSort was that slow. I thought SelectionSort would be the ultimate slow sorter, but by 160,000 - it took 3m54.635s, which was a significant step-up from 80,000's 0m27.549s.
- Slower: SelectionSort, InsertionSort
- Faster: MergeSort, Quicksort

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
- It was challenging understanding the ins and outs of each sorting algorithm. Even just watching the videos alone was not sufficient. What helped me the most was developing a pseudocode and poking holes in my understanding that way, and fleshing out that "perfect" pseudocode would almost always run within the first one or two tries. 
- Interesting thing: I watched this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4JVT3eVBP8) very fun YouTube video and it gave me a more realistic view on running algorithms as well as just give me more love for the algos themselves.
